# Simple Java-based marketplace application designed to showcase design patterns as a part of a class project.

## Design Patterns used:
* The Singleton Design Pattern was used to guarantee that the AppDatabase class only has one instance while still giving a global access point to it.
* On the FileOutput interface, the Factory Method Design pattern was utilized because ErrorOutput and CheckoutOutput used comparable objects, but the types of objects used were different.
* The FileHelper class used the Decorator Design pattern to use a filepath that was independent of the ProcessOrder or Inventory Class.
